<p>My main interest lies in the low-level details 🔧 of modern computer systems. I am interested in the design of operating systems and the architecture of the world-wide web. Lately, I am interested to dive into the field of digital forensics and malware research 🔍 which will be the topic of my Final Year Project in NUS.</p>
<p>In my free time, I occasionally play badminton and Dota 2 with my friends. I also like to swim 🏊‍♂️ and play guitar 🎸.</p>

<p><strong>Information Security Intern, TRS Forensics</strong></p>
<p>Singapore, Dec 2021 - May 2022</p>
<p>In TRS, I was part of its forensics and cybersecurity department. I started with the forensics department, where I went to the client&rsquo;s office to perform exhibit management and image acquisition using state-of-the-art digital forensics tool. I also learnt how to perform the analysis on the captured image file. Next, on the cybersecurity department, I was assigned to attack a virtual box and perform bug bounty for my on-the-job training. Then, I was involved in real pentesting with a client. I mostly dealt with web and API pentesting, but I was also exposed a little bit to Android pentesting. I helped the team to perform research on WiFi cracking, and developed two internal tools for penetration testing and data visualisation.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity Intern, Envision Digital International</strong></p>
<p>Singapore, Jun 2021 - Sep 2021</p>
<p>In EDI, I was lucky to be involved in numerous projects with different supervisors from different cybersecurity departments. At the beginning, I was involved in the selection of Governance Risk and Compliance tool to streamline monitor the IT compliance process against industry standards such as ISO27000, COBIT 5, and PCI DSS. Then, I helped the security architect to set up a SIEM system using Elasticsearch which collects and processes system logs from IoT devices. I was also involved in securing the company&rsquo;s proprietary products by performing threat modelling on one of the product and incorporating a Software Composition Analysis tool in the DevOps pipeline. Last but not least, I learnt about digital forensics and incident handling, albeit very limited.</p>
