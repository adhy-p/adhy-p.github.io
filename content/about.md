## About This Page

The main purpose of this page is to cache the things I learned, so I can access them more easily. However, if you find the content interesting and useful, then it's a win for me as well :v:

## My Interest

---

My main interest lies in the low-level details :wrench: of modern computer systems. I am interested in the design of operating systems and the architecture of the world-wide web. Lately, I am interested to dive into the field of digital forensics and malware research :mag: which will be the topic of my Final Year Project in NUS.

In my free time, I occasionally play badminton and Dota 2 with my friends. I also like to swim :swimmer: and play guitar :guitar:.

## My Experiences

**Information Security Intern, TRS Forensics**

Singapore, Dec 2021 - May 2022

In TRS, I was part of its forensics and cybersecurity department. I started with the forensics department, where I went to the client's office to perform exhibit management and image acquisition using state-of-the-art digital forensics tool. I also learnt how to perform the analysis on the captured image file. Next, on the cybersecurity department, I was assigned to attack a virtual box and perform bug bounty for my on-the-job training. Then, I was involved in real pentesting with a client. I mostly dealt with web and API pentesting, but I was also exposed a little bit to Android pentesting. I helped the team to perform research on WiFi cracking, and developed two internal tools for penetration testing and data visualisation.

**Cybersecurity Intern, Envision Digital International**

Singapore, Jun 2021 - Sep 2021

In EDI, I was lucky to be involved in numerous projects with different supervisors from different cybersecurity departments. At the beginning, I was involved in the selection of Governance Risk and Compliance tool to streamline monitor the IT compliance process against industry standards such as ISO27000, COBIT 5, and PCI DSS. Then, I helped the security architect to set up a SIEM system using Elasticsearch which collects and processes system logs from IoT devices. I was also involved in securing the company's proprietary products by performing threat modelling on one of the product and incorporating a Software Composition Analysis tool in the DevOps pipeline. Last but not least, I learnt about digital forensics and incident handling, albeit very limited.
