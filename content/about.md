The main purpose of this page is to cache the things I learned, so I can access them more easily. However, if you find the content interesting and useful, then it's a win for me as well :v:

## My Interest

---
I am a [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming) person who really enjoy learning about operating systems and computer networks. Also, when it comes to computers, there are two things that I really like: automating stuffs and seeing things go blazingly fast. I find it really satisfying when my bash/python scripts does everything I wanted in a single command. I also find joy in doing benchmarking and optimization.

In my free time, I occasionally play badminton and Dota 2 with my friends. I also like to swim :swimmer: and play guitar :guitar:

## My Experiences

**Full Time Teaching Assistant, NUS** :mortar_board:

Singapore, Jul 2023 - Present

I am currently teaching CS2030S, an introductory module for first and second year students who are keen to write clean, extensible, and maintainable code. The first half of the module covers basic OOP concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. The second half gives an introduction to immutability and functional programming, as well as other interesting CS concepts such as lazy evaluation, asynchronous programming, and task deque and work-stealing.

When I am not teaching, I like to sit in on interesting courses in NUS which I had missed during my undergraduate. Currently, I am attending classes about compilers, distributed databases, and computer systems performance analysis.

**Information Security Intern, TRS Forensics** :detective:

Singapore, Dec 2021 - May 2022

In TRS, I was part of its forensics and cybersecurity department. I started with the forensics department, where I went to the client's office to perform exhibit management and image acquisition using state-of-the-art digital forensics tool. I also learnt how to perform the analysis on the captured image file. Next, on the cybersecurity department, I was assigned to attack a virtual box and perform bug bounty for my on-the-job training. Then, I was involved in real pentesting with a client. I mostly dealt with web and API pentesting, but I was also exposed a little bit to Android pentesting. I helped the team to perform research on WiFi cracking, and developed two internal tools for penetration testing and data visualisation.

**Cybersecurity Intern, Envision Digital International** :battery:

Singapore, Jun 2021 - Sep 2021

In EDI, I was lucky to be involved in numerous projects with different supervisors from different cybersecurity departments. At the beginning, I was involved in the selection of Governance Risk and Compliance tool to streamline monitor the IT compliance process against industry standards such as ISO27000, COBIT 5, and PCI DSS. Then, I helped the security architect to set up a SIEM system using Elasticsearch which collects and processes system logs from IoT devices. I was also involved in securing the company's proprietary products by performing threat modelling on one of the product and incorporating a Software Composition Analysis tool in the DevOps pipeline. Last but not least, I learnt about digital forensics and incident handling, albeit very limited.
